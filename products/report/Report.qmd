## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| output: flase
#| # Load libraries
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(unibeCols)
```
## Introuction

The aim of this exercise is to visualize the increase in laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Switzerland during autumn 2020

## Data

We read and process the data of laboratory-confirmed cases og Covid-19 in Switzerland as reported by [Federal OFfice of Public HEalth (http://https://idd.bag.admin.ch/)]

```{r}
#| output: false
# Read data
cases <- read_csv(here("data/raw/COVID19Cases_geoRegion.csv"))
```

```{r}
#Process data 
region <- "CH"
window_start <- ymd("2020-09-01")
window_end <- ymd("2020-11-30")
cases <- cases |>
  filter(geoRegion == region & datum >= window_start & datum <= window_end) |>
  select(datum, entries)
cases 
```

@fig-cases shows the number of lavorairy.confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Switzerland from `r` window_start` to `r window_end`.

```{r}
#| label: fig-cases
#| fig-cap: "Laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Switzerland in 2020."
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4
ggplot(cases, aes(x = datum, y = entries)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = unibeSaphire()) + 
  labs(x = "", 
       y = "Laboratory-confirmed cases") + 
  theme_minimal()
```


##Conclusions

The number of laboratory-confirmed cases
